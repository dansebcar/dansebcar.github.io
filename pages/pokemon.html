    Usually, Pokémon type charts are presented in a grid, but the information is often
    overwhelming, so I made this handy interactive type chart. Just choose the type
    you're attacking with and you'll see how that will do against your opponent.
    Alternatively, hit the checkbox so that you can specify your defending type,
    and how that will behave when you get hit.
